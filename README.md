# validating-results
This classifier was built as part of a project to develop ML solutions which could test and validate/invalidate experimental results
without having to collect additional data. Instead, the initial sample can be divided into training and test data after which, depending on
the accuracy of the classifier, one can implement it on the remaining observations in the sample. The results have shown that the classifier
has an accuracy of ~ 0.3, which is low. This could be due to the high number of dimensions or to the small number of training observations 
which were about 30 observations.
